# Credit_card Power BI Dashboard Project

# Introduction
Welcome to the Power BI Dashboard Project! This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to provide insightful visualizations and data analysis based on a specific dataset. The dashboard focuses on various aspects, including gender, car ownership, property ownership, annual income, education, marital status, housing type, type of occupation, age, years of experience, family size, and a label indicating an individual's classification.

# Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

To create an interactive and informative Power BI dashboard for analyzing the provided dataset.
To gain insights into the relationships and patterns within the data.
To facilitate data-driven decision-making through visualizations and analysis.
# Key Features
The project offers the following key features:

Visualizations: The dashboard includes a variety of charts, graphs, and tables to represent data visually.
Data Exploration: Users can interact with the data, apply filters, and drill down into specific details.
Customization: The dashboard is customizable to adapt to different datasets and user needs.

# Dataset Description
